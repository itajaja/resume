## Working Experience

### Software Engineer -- Hyla Soft -- 2013-today
I am working as a software engineer at Hyla Soft. I focus on building web applications for custom solutions, supervise the software development process and standards company-wise. I leverage and push new web technologies in an enterprise context. Some project and initiatives I led:

- *JSM (2014)*: Design and implementation of an order management system for small part manufacturing shop floors. JSM is focused on simplicity, ease of use and configuration, high modularity and extensibility, modern web interface.
  - Commissioned by a software vendor, JSM integrates and ships with company flagship product.
  - Technologies used: C#, ASP.NET WebApi, MSSQL, Typescript, SASS/Compass, Bootstrap, Grunt, Bower.
- *SPOM (2014)*: Design and implementation of a system to manage and monitor operations in an oil and lubricant manufacturing company.
  - Integration of different systems and protocols: ERP, machine controllers (through OPC).
  - Technologies used: C#, ServiceStack, MSSQL, Typescript, SASS, Angular Material, Gulp, Grunt, Bower, Appveyor CI, Electron.
- *Hyla Soft SW Development Initiative*: I helped Hyla Soft improve company's software development projects by fostering best practices, standard tools and products, a healthy engineering culture, and modernizing the technological stack.
  - The results are summarized in these slides: https://goo.gl/cCXYfW.
