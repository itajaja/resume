Hi, I am Giacomo, a full stack developer, I like crafting software that matters. I am interested in the web, programming language theory and software architecture.

## Technologies and skills

I am *very good* at: C#, .NET, REST services, OOP, automated testing.  
I am *quite good* at:  ES6/Typescript, AngularJS, node, functional programming, SQL.  
I am *good* at: CSS3, SASS, HTML5, NoSQL.  
I am a *beginner* at: Scala, react, F#, C++.  
Some tools and practices I use on a daily basis: grunt, gulp, Continuous Integration, git, github-flow, bash/zsh, powershell, Visual Studio, Sublime Text.

The rest, I hope to learn one day.

## Working Experience

### Software Engineer -- Hyla Soft -- 2013-today
I am currently working as a software engineer at Hyla Soft. I mainly focus on building web application for custom solutions and I supervise the software development process and standards company-wise, trying to leverage the new web technologies in an enterprise context. These are some project and initiatives I led:

- *JSM (2014)*: Design and implementation of an order management system for small part manufacturing shop floors, focused on simplicity, ease of use and configuration, high modularity and extensibility, modern web interface
  - Commissioned by a software vendor, it integrates and ships with their flagship product
  - Technologies used: C#, ASP.NET WebApi, MSSQL, Typescript, SASS/Compass, Bootstrap, Grunt, Bower
- *SPOM (2014)*: Design and implementation of a system to manage and monitor operations in an oil and lubricant manufacturing company
  - integration of different systems and protocols: ERP, Machine controllers (through OPC).
  - Technologies used: C#, ServiceStack, MSSQL, Typescript, SASS, Angular Material, Gulp, Grunt, Bower, Appveyor CI, electron
- *Hyla Soft SW Development Initiative*: I helped Hyla Soft to improve the results of their software development projects, by fostering best practices, standard tools and products, an healthy engineering culture, and modernizing the technological stack.
  - The results are partly summarized in these slides: [goo.gl/cCXYfW](https://goo.gl/cCXYfW)
