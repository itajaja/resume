## Work Experience

### Head of Cloud -- 4Catalyzer -- 2015-today
Designing and implementing cloud platforms for multiple startups in the healthcare/medical devices industry, as well as facilitating knowledge sharing and best practices across the startups.

- *4Catalyzer -- Head of Cloud*: Some of my responsibilities as head of cloud include facilitating sharing of knowledge and code, ensuring best practices and coding standards, consulting for cloud system technical design, reviewing code, hiring.
- *Quantum-SI -- Software Engineer*: As full stack developer I work on different features, most notably: implemented a distributed workflow platform for executing third-party code in a secure and performant manner; led the effort to migrate to Kubernetes, designed and implemented a fault tolerant publish-subscribe/queue-based system for communication across microservices. **Technologies used**: AWS (EC2, SQS, SNS and others), Kubernetes, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Redis, Graphql, React, Webpack.
- *Butterfly Network -- Software Engineer*: Working full stack on new features for the cloud platform. Implemented reliable automation. Worked toward achieving HIPAA compliance. **Technologies used**: Django, Docker, Graphql, React, Webpack.


### Software Engineer -- Hyla Soft -- 2013-2015
Built web applications to provide solutions for the manufacturing industry, and supervised the software development process and standards company-wide. I leveraged and pushed new web technologies in an enterprise context. Some projects and initiatives I led:

- *JSM (2014)*: Design and implementation of an order management system for small part manufacturing shop floors. JSM is focused on simplicity, ease of use and configuration, high modularity and extensibility, modern web interface. **Technologies used**: C#, ASP.NET WebApi, MSSQL, Typescript, SASS/Compass, Bootstrap, Grunt, Bower.
- *SPOM (2014)*: Design and implementation of a system to manage and monitor operations in an oil and lubricant manufacturing company. **Technologies used**: C#, ServiceStack, MSSQL, Typescript, SASS, Angular Material, Gulp, Grunt, Bower, Appveyor CI, Electron.
- *Hyla Soft SW Development Initiative*: I helped Hyla Soft improve company's software development projects by fostering best practices, standard tools and products, a healthy engineering culture, and modernizing the technological stack. The results are summarized in these slides: https://goo.gl/cCXYfW.

### Research Assistant -- DARPA / University of Illinois at Chicago -- 2012-2013
Employed in DARPA's CSFV (Crowd Sourced Formal Verification) Project. CSFV investigates extensions of compilers' optimizations using formal verification.
Technologies used: C++, LLVM-CLANG infrastructure, Z3 SAT solver.
